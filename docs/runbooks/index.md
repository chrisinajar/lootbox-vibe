- id: short summary — when to use

Runbooks:
- package-manager: Use Yarn for Node tasks; avoid npm — when editing package.json/scripts, installing deps, or writing CI/docs that run Node commands.
- readme-maintenance: Keep README accurate with docs-first structure and Yarn workflow — when changing docs structure, scripts, or onboarding steps.
- dependency-management: Manage dependencies with Yarn; never hand-edit versions — when adding/upgrading/removing packages or resolving advisories.
