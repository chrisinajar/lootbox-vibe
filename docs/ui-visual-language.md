# ui visual language

The UI uses a consistent visual language for rarity, modifiers, and box themes to keep the experience readable and fun.

## rarity colors

- common: gray
- uncommon: green
- rare: blue
- epic: purple
- legendary (future): orange

## modifier treatments

- cosmetic-only: playful visuals such as rainbow text and subtle shiny glows.
- mechanical: small icon chips (e.g., scrap coin, key icon, arrow for multipliers) without excessive color noise.

## box themes

- cardboard: plain brown, light shake animation.
- wooden: rustic palette, creak animation.
- iron: heavy metallic, clang animation.
- unstable: glitch flicker and vfx accents.

## animation and sound

- framer motion powers box shake, reward pop-ins, and currency counter tick-ups.
- distinct sfx for open, rare pull, and salvage; sfx are on by default and toggleable in settings.

See `docs/runbooks/ui-juice-settings.md` for implementation details and settings.
